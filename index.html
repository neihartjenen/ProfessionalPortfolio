        <p>Hello, my name is Jenen Neihart and I am a graduate from the University of Arizona class of 2018. After working a sales job for over a year I realized computers is always something I've been passionate about. So I set forth to learn. Now, I am the one who has created this site and I'm proud to announce I am graduating from a coding bootcamp through the University of Arizona in June 2020 and will be looking for new opportunties.</p>
